### Guidelines for adding solutions
-----------------------------------
 - Files should be given the same title as the question
 - Create your own branch and add your solutions there. Then, merge your changes into the main branch when you are ready to discuss your work.
 - In each solution, put your name, the runtime of the code, and the question description in the header.
 
    ```java
    /******************************************************************
    * Written by: [your name]
    * Runtime: [time in milliseconds]
    * Given a list of unique words. Find all pairs of distinct indices 
    * (i, j) in the given list, so that the concatenation of the two 
    * words, i.e. words[i] + words[j] is a palindrome.
    ********************************************************************/
    ```
